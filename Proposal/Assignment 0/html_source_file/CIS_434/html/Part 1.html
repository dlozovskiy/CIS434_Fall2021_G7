<h4>Part 1</h4>
<p> Hello! My name is Daniel Lozovskiy. I am a junior Computer Science Major at Cleveland State University. My goal for CIS 434 is to develop and practice effective software engineering strategies. Along the way, I would learn and understand the phases and different methodologies of software development.</p></a>

<p>In previous courses, I have learned to use Java, C, C++, assembly language, and Python. On my own time I have explored HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP in order to modify and develop websites. Although I am not advanced in these languages, I am familiar and will work hard to get the result I am looking for.</p>

<p>In addition, here is a little about myself. I am the fourth child of first generation immigrants from Ukraine. They are my role models to work hard. When I first started taking classes at CSU, I was on track to get a major in Biology as part of the process to get into medical school. Once I took some upper division biology courses, I realized that I was not passionate about medicine nor people enough to commit to the course. Around the same time, I was helping develop my churches website. There would be many late nights where I would research and implement different features and formats into the website. I found something I was passionate about. I am not sure if it was design, or programming, or both. Nevertheless, I decided to take on copmuter science in order to pursue a career in developing and designing software.</p>
