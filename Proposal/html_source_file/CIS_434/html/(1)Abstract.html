<p><h3>Abstract</h3></p>
<p>A Point of Sale system (POS) is a device used to handle the transaction between a business and the customer. Restaurants use these systems to place and keep track of orders. It can take serves valuable time to input orders or outdated systems, even some restaurants still use handwritten orders which can lead to mistakes being made based on sloppy handwriting. 
    Our project is to create a POS system intended to be used by a restaurant to both to increase the productivity of the servers and help manage the restaurant. Our POS system will be able to handle orders, table seating, reservations, checkout, and some inventory management. With our intended design it should make the ordering process simple and efficient 
    allowing for greater accuracy and speed which can be crucial during a rush. The benefits of a restaurant adapting the use of POS software are high and with few drawbacks. When using the POS system, the restaurant can expect to have a user-friendly interface that will be easy to comprehend and be able to allow servers to use it quickly without a long training 
    period. With the evolution of the POS system, it slowly became the control center for the restaurant allowing for the POS system to take on bigger and bigger roles thus, leading to may developments and features to be added. The goal of this proposed POS system is to help hold the weight of managing the restaurant as well as give the customer an easy and clean 
    experience checking out. In order to develop this software, we will need to develop a user-friendly GUI that allows for seamless transitions between screens views as well ease of use. Along with all this it almost must remain in a suitable functional layout to help increase the flow the workers will have when operating the POS system. After this implementation
    is competed the various features will be added one by one ensuing its respective functionality.<p/>
