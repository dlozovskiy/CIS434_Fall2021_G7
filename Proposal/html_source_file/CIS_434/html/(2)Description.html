<p><h3>Project Description</h3></p>

<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>
<ul>

	<p>The twenty-first century is known formation technologies, and as technology rapidly advance, many restaurants advantage new technology. In recent years, the restaurant Point-of-Sale (POS) system has evolved dramatically. The most popular (modern) POS systems include lightspeed, Clover and Toast, etc. All these POS systems allow restaurants to place orders for the customers, keep track of restaurant inventory, etc. In fact, the first POS was a cash register, invented in 1879. The first commercial use of POS system was created by IBM in 1973. IBM’s POS system  allowed restaurants to process and record orders. As the technology evolved,  POS systems became the control center for every restaurant and, an essential database of transactional data that we use today.<p/>
	<p>We propose an ordering system, which simplifies the ordering process for both the customer and the restaurant staff. The POS system wouldIt offer restaurant an appliance that allows servers or managers to place orders, make reservations, show when any food is sold out, and send orders directly to the kitchen. After customers make their selection, customers can review the details of their selection at the checkout page, providing instant visual confirmation of what was being purchased. POS systems It reduces order mistakes and helps to prevent confusions for the customers.  <p/>
	<p>POS systems also lightened the heavy load that was on restaurants. Today, restaurant staffs no longer need to write down orders manually, as the entire process of taking orders can be done through the system.  It allows restaurant managers better manage their staff for food preparation or other services.  Researchers predicts that, in near future, retail point of sale will be more cloud centric. Cloud apps will enable retailers to better manage their sales, inventory, and customers across several stores and channels.  <p/>

<p><h4>Objectives</h4></p>
<ul>
	<p>General objective:<p/>
	<p>• Improve efficiency of ordering process. <p/>
	<p>•Increase speed of services, sales volumes, and customer satisfaction.<p/>
	<p>Ordering system specifications:  <p/>
	<p>•Enable user to place order, including special request such as food ingredients. <p/>
	<p>•Enable to show abnormal process such as sold-out items, change of the order etc.<p/>
	<p>•Enable user to make a reservation and change table.<p/>
	<p>•Enable user apply loyalty membership and discount voucher.<p/>
	<p>• Allow user request additional services such as gifts, promotional items.<p/>

		Creating a POS system carries a necessity to consider the security of the customer as well as the restaurant. The POS system can not allow for the customer’s credit and debit card information get compromised as well as it must be able to protect the employee’s private information. As the developers of this POS system, it is our responsibility to make sure that all personal data is not allowed to be publicly accessible. We also hold the ethical responsibility to not have the POS system itself steal the customer or the employee’s private data. This includes logging the credit and debit card information for personal use or using the employee’s information to steal any of their identities. Without being able to provide these services to the upmost of our ability we would be in violation of the engineering code of ethics.<br /><br />
		This POS system will be able to be further adapted and molded to meet the rising and increasing needs for the users of the system. With continued growth and development, it allows for the needs of our POS software to also be ever changing allowing for its longevity. This cycle of lifelong learning and continued updates is crucial to the development of better software as it will allow for new developments while the older features become more developed and refined to better suit the needs at the given time, as well as the customer. While the newly developed features will have their spotlight to shine and bring forward new capabilities.<br /><br />
		The impact of this POS system on restaurants is not small. With the addition of the POS system the restaurant will be able to increase organization, speed, clarity, and analytical capabilities. This will be a great benefit for the restaurant and better allow for growth and expansion in the future of the business. On the customer side of the implementation the customer will receive an easy and swift check out experience. This will allow for both a better customer interaction and also for more people to be checked out in a shorter amount of time allowing for the possibility of scaling one’s business to heights that was once not reachable. These benefits are great for both sides of those who interact with the POS system allowing for a greater positive impact on the society as a whole.<br /><br />

<p><h4>Project Timelines</h4></p>

<ul>
	<p>For the first half of the project, it is important to develop and implement the main features of the food ordering system. This includes the GUI to create orders from the menu. The second half of the project will include agile development of subsequent features. These features include checkout features, table managment, and reservations.<p/>

<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>
<ul>
	<p>
		Handwriting customer’s orders is outdated and has many limitations; It takes a longer amount of time to place an order, increases chances of human error, and can be a huge burden on restaurants. As this project is for developing an ordering system application for restaurants, the application  allows restaurant staff to order for customers, change orders, and see which menu items are sold out. The ordering system  also enables customers to apply for VIP Card points at the checkout. The proposed systemIt also allows restaurant staff to reserve and change tables forat special dates, times, and locations. This ordering system has fulfilled its objectives by.  It improvinges business management and service delivery.  POS systems in restaurants are convenient, effective, and easy to use, reducing the amount of time it takes to place and order and improving the overall performance of the restaurant. In the future, POS systems will become more sophisticated to meet user needs. Some of current POS systems haves already started to focus on areas such as checking food temperature, monitoring food safety, and sales reporting and forecasting.  According to Grand View Research, the market for POS systems has grown significantly and the, POS market is expected to reach $25 billion by 2028, driven by the benefits these systems provide in a quickly changing environment.
