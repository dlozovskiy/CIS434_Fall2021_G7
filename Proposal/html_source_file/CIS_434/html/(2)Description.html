		Creating a POS system carries a necessity to consider the security of the customer as well as the restaurant. The POS system can not allow for the customer’s credit and debit card information get compromised as well as it must be able to protect the employee’s private information. As the developers of this POS system, it is our responsibility to make sure that all personal data is not allowed to be publicly accessible. We also hold the ethical responsibility to not have the POS system itself steal the customer or the employee’s private data. This includes logging the credit and debit card information for personal use or using the employee’s information to steal any of their identities. Without being able to provide these services to the upmost of our ability we would be in violation of the engineering code of ethics.<br /><br />
		This POS system will be able to be further adapted and molded to meet the rising and increasing needs for the users of the system. With continued growth and development, it allows for the needs of our POS software to also be ever changing allowing for its longevity. This cycle of lifelong learning and continued updates is crucial to the development of better software as it will allow for new developments while the older features become more developed and refined to better suit the needs at the given time, as well as the customer. While the newly developed features will have their spotlight to shine and bring forward new capabilities.<br /><br />
		The impact of this POS system on restaurants is not small. With the addition of the POS system the restaurant will be able to increase organization, speed, clarity, and analytical capabilities. This will be a great benefit for the restaurant and better allow for growth and expansion in the future of the business. On the customer side of the implementation the customer will receive an easy and swift check out experience. This will allow for both a better customer interaction and also for more people to be checked out in a shorter amount of time allowing for the possibility of scaling one’s business to heights that was once not reachable. These benefits are great for both sides of those who interact with the POS system allowing for a greater positive impact on the society as a whole.<br /><br />
