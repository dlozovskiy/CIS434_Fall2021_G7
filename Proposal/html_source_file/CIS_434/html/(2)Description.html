<p><h3>Project Description</h3></p>

<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>
<ul>

	<p>Twenty-first Century are known as the formation technologies, as technology rapidly advance,many restaurants has taken advantage of it. In most recent years, restaurant Point-of-Sale (POS) system evolved dramatically. The most popular modern POS includes lightspeed, Clover and Toast, etc. All these POS systems allow restaurants to place order for the customers, some of them able to keep track of restaurant inventory, etc. In fact, the first POS was a cash register invented in 1879. The first commercial use of POS system was created By IBM in 1973. It allowed restaurants to process and record order. As the technology evolved, the POS system became the control center for every restaurant, an essential database of transactional data that we know today.<p/>
	<p> While we propose an ordering system, it simplifies the ordering process for both the customer and the restaurant. It offers the restaurant an appliance that allow restaurant server or manager to place order, make reservation and show abnormal process when any food is sold out and send orders directly to the kitchen. After customer make their selection, customer can review the details of their selection at checking out page. This provides instant visual confirmation of what was being check-out. It reduces order mistakes and confusions for customers.  <p/>
	<p>This system also lifted the heavy load that were on the restaurants. Today, restaurant staffs no longer need to write down orders manually, as the entire process of taking orders can be done through the system.  It allows restaurant managers better manage their staff for food preparation or other services.  Researchers predicts, in near future, retail point of sale will be more cloud centric. Cloud apps will enable retailers to better manage their sales, inventory, and customers across several stores and channels. <p/>

<p><h4>Objectives</h4></p>
<ul>
	<p>General objective:<p/>
	<p>• Improve efficiency of ordering process. <p/>
	<p>•Increase speed of services, sales volumes, and customer satisfaction.<p/>
	<p>Ordering system specifications:  <p/>
	<p>•Enable user to place order, including special request such as food ingredients. <p/>
	<p>•Enable to show abnormal process such as sold-out items, change of the order etc.<p/>
	<p>•Enable user to make a reservation and change table.<p/>

		Creating a POS system carries a necessity to consider the security of the customer as well as the restaurant. The POS system can not allow for the customer’s credit and debit card information get compromised as well as it must be able to protect the employee’s private information. As the developers of this POS system, it is our responsibility to make sure that all personal data is not allowed to be publicly accessible. We also hold the ethical responsibility to not have the POS system itself steal the customer or the employee’s private data. This includes logging the credit and debit card information for personal use or using the employee’s information to steal any of their identities. Without being able to provide these services to the upmost of our ability we would be in violation of the engineering code of ethics.<br /><br />
		This POS system will be able to be further adapted and molded to meet the rising and increasing needs for the users of the system. With continued growth and development, it allows for the needs of our POS software to also be ever changing allowing for its longevity. This cycle of lifelong learning and continued updates is crucial to the development of better software as it will allow for new developments while the older features become more developed and refined to better suit the needs at the given time, as well as the customer. While the newly developed features will have their spotlight to shine and bring forward new capabilities.<br /><br />
		The impact of this POS system on restaurants is not small. With the addition of the POS system the restaurant will be able to increase organization, speed, clarity, and analytical capabilities. This will be a great benefit for the restaurant and better allow for growth and expansion in the future of the business. On the customer side of the implementation the customer will receive an easy and swift check out experience. This will allow for both a better customer interaction and also for more people to be checked out in a shorter amount of time allowing for the possibility of scaling one’s business to heights that was once not reachable. These benefits are great for both sides of those who interact with the POS system allowing for a greater positive impact on the society as a whole.<br /><br />

<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>
<ul>
	<p>
		 Traditional handwriting orders are outdated and has many limitations. It takes longer time to place an order, higher chance of human error and cause huge burden on restaurants. As this project is for developing an ordering system application for restaurants. This ordering system application allow restaurant staff order for customer, change orders, and see which menu items are sold out. The ordering system also enable apply VIP Card points at the checkout. It also allows restaurant staff to reserve and change table at special date, time, and location. This ordering system has fulfilled its objectives.  It improves business management and service delivery.  It is convenient, effective, and easy to use. It reduces time for placed an order and improves overall performance of the restaurant. In future, POS system will be more sophisticated to meet user needs. As some of current POS system has already start focus on areas such as checking food temperature, monitoring food safety and sales reporting and forecasting.  According to Grand View Research,  The market for POS system has growth significantly, POS market is expected to reach $25 billion by 2028, driven by the benefits these systems provide in a quickly changing environment.
